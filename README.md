# Udacity Front End Track: Project 5 "Restaurant Reviews App"

This is the fifth project and the last one of the **Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program**.

## Project Overview

This project is made for the Udacity classroom on Front-End Web Developement.

For this project, we have to convert a static website to mobile ready web application. This website lacks accessibility and needs to be responsive on different screen sizes and to be accessible by screen readers. It also has to be converted into a Progressive web app by caching some assets for offline.

**Specification**
You will be provided code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

**Leaflet.js and Mapbox:**
This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from Mapbox. Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. You can also use Google maps.

**How to get the map on the screen:**
**For Mapbox**, head over to your account and create a token. Replace the text `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` in "main.js" with your key.  
Do the same thing inside "restaurant_info.js".

**For Google Maps**, replace the text `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in index.html and restaurant.html with your own key.

## How to run

After you clone/download the project, you can either:
1. Open the live version [here]().
2. Or run it on your local machine following thses instructions.

##### Run on your local machine:

A simple HTTP server can serve the files. We are going to use python for this. Before we proceed, check which python's version installed in your machine by running: `python --version`. If there's no version installed, so go ahead and download [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:  
    Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000  
    Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000
2. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000
